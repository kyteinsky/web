Warm wishes to Imgur on their next chapter! The online media sharing platform has been acquired by [MediaLab](https://imgur.com/gallery/We6yCM2), joining a portfolio of other notable Internet brands like Kik, Whisper, Genius, WorldStarHipHop and more. Founded by Alan Schaff in 2009, Imgur is a place for users to easily upload, share, and interact with entertaining images, memes, and videos. A favorite tool for users of Reddit and Twitter, Imgur describes itself  as “the easiest way to discover and enjoy the magic of the Internet.”  
Ory is proud to provide scalable OAuth2.0 provider infrastructure to Imgur, which has implemented [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra), our certified OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider. Just like Ory, Imgur is a community-powered organization that relies on a global network of contributors to provide the best possible user experience. The Ory community is excited to see how Imgur expands as a hub for community-powered online entertainment and hopes they continue to build on Ory.
